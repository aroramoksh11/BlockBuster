# BlockBuster
**Introduction**

The BlockBuster is a simple and effective tool for helping you stay focused and productive during work or study hours. It allows you to block access to distracting websites during specific time periods, such as during work hours or late at night. By redirecting these websites to the localhost IP address, you won't be able to access them, helping you to stay focused and on-task.

**Installation**

To use the Website Blocker, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, download the BlockBuster.py file from the project repository.

**Usage**

After downloading the BlockBuster.py file, open it in a text editor and modify the website_list, start_time, and end_time variables to suit your needs. Once you have made your changes, save the file and run it using the Python interpreter. The program will run in the background and block access to the specified websites during the specified time range.
